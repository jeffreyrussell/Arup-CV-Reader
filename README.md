# Arup-CV-Reader

This script was created to simplify the process of pulling important information from Arup's internal CVs. 

## Note:
When the conversion from .docx to .pdf is ongoing, keep and eye out for any pop-ups that are forcing the script to pause. Common pop-ups include MS Word 'do you want to save?' dialogues and MS Word 'select confidentiality status' dialogues. Always make sure to select 'Yes' to save, and select 'Ok' after selecting a confidentiality status.
